I wanted my website to have to specific primary colors: red #952C2C, and green #95AE58. Then also have teriatry colors of gray and black. I wanted a mix of the typeface "Lobster" and a general san-serif typeface in my website, with some other typefaces. With all these colors and typefaces, I wanted it to make my website feel: bright, artsy, colorful, fun, and playful.
